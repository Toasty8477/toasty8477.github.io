                <p>Hey, I'm Alex! I'm currently a second year student at Milwaukee School of Engineering
                    pursuing a bachelors in Software Engineering and expecting to graduate in 2028.
                    When I'm not in class I serve as the Vice President of SAGA, run registration
                    for <a href="https://concinnitycon.weebly.com/">Concinnity</a>, attend multiple
                    events as part of MAGE, and play in the concert and pep bands. Outside of school
                    I enjoy watching motorsports, sim racing, messing with small electronics, running
                    model trains, and making and listening to music.
