                <p id="project2" class="compact">An image manipulator that can read and write
                    custom file extentions and apply custom filters.<br><br>
                    Written as part of the Data Structures course at MSOE.
                    Image Manipulator 3000 was written in Java and JavaFX to create a two
                    window interface. The program reads the common jpeg and png formats as
                    well as two custom formats .msoe, a plain text format, and .bmsoe, a binary format.
                    The program was created as part of two labs near the beginning of the course
                    to apply the JavaFX SceneBuilder and create a more complex GUI as well as practicing
                    file IO from the end of Into to Software Development. You can find the code
                    <a href="https://github.com/Toasty8477/school-code/tree/master/csc-1120/labs/lab-4" target="_blank">here</a>
                    along with all the other code I've written for school.

                <h3>Home Assistant MQTT Remote</h3>
                <p id="project3" class="compact">A simple device that connects to 
                    <a href="https://home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> using the MQTT protocol.<br><br>
                    One of my first physical projects and the first one with any kind
                    of documentation. MQTT Remote uses micropython running on an Espressif ESP8266,
                    specificaly a Wemos D1 Mini, to read the states of some buttons and a 
                    potentiometer and sends them to Home Assistant over MQTT. I created this before
                    really getting into <a href="https://esphome.io/">ESPHome</a> which is what most
                    of my projects have been based on since. Originially I intended to create some
                    kind of case for the device but never got around to it.
